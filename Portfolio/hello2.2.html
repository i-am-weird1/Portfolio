<h1>REFLECTION: "My Online Class Journey"</h1>




<p style="border: 3px solid tomato; padding: 2px;"> <i> Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc. </i> </p> 

<div style="background-color: hsl(10, 100%, 80%); margin: 30 px 0; padding: 10 px">
<p> The moment the online class started I was at first scared and anxious of what was going to happen because I am very new to it but as time goes on I am becoming much more used to it, so the challenges that I always encounter everyday is I am always tempted to play video games instead so now I have trained myself to focus on school and not video games and the funny moments experience were alot and if I were to write all of them it would take it very long but one in particular is that I have accidentally open mic in class and said "AHHHHHH" for 10 seconds and I was so so embarrased from that moment and I can still remember it like it was yesterday, so my personal suggestion for online learning is that I recommend to rest after class to rest your eyes and to be prepared for the afternoon class.
